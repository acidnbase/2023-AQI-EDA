# 2023-AQI-EDA
The aim of this project is to analyze air quality data to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and factors affecting air quality across different cities and states. 
By exploring the dataset, we seek to answer various questions related to air quality, including the contribution of pollutants, seasonal patterns.

## Dataset 
The dataset used in this project was compiled from the EPA's Air Quality Index Daily Values Report. It contains information about air quality measurements, including the AQI values, main pollutants, monitoring sites, and geographic locations.

### Dataset Fields
1. Date the measure was taken
2. Overall AQI value
3. Main Pollutant
4. Name of site where the AQI value was measured
5. ID of site where the AQI value was measured
6. Source of overall AQI value
7. Ozone level
8. PM25 level
9. CO level
10. PM10 level
11. NO2 level
12. AQI category (good, moderate, unhealthy, etc.)
13. City name
14. State name

## Questions to be Answered
1. What is the overall trend of air quality (measured by AQI) over time across different cities and states?
2. Which pollutant(s) contribute most to poor air quality in different cities?
3. Are there any seasonal patterns in air quality across different cities and states?
4. What are the most common AQI categories observed across different cities and states?
5. How does air quality differ between different monitoring sites within the same city?

## Code Implementation
The project code is implemented in Python using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Each question is addressed through code snippets that performs necessary transformations, and generate visualizations or summary statistics to answer the question.
